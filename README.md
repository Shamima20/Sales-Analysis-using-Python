#  Sales Analysis Using Applied Data Science with Python

This project analyzes sales data across different states and product groups, uncovering hidden trends and business insights using Python and exploratory data analysis.

##  Problem Statement

Sales data often holds valuable patterns that can inform marketing, inventory, and operational strategies. This project aims to explore and visualize sales data to:
- Identify top-performing product groups and states
- Spot underperforming areas or times
- Extract actionable insights from historical patterns

##  Dataset

- 7,560 rows of transaction-level data
- Columns: Date, Time, State, Group, Units Sold, Sales Amount
- Source: Internal business dataset

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Areas

- Time-based sales trends (day, hour, etc.)
- State-wise sales breakdown
- Group-wise performance
- Correlation between Units and Sales
- High and low performing combinations (State + Group)

##  What I Did

- Cleaned and processed the raw data
- Visualized insights using bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps
- Drew insights around peak sales periods and high-performing regions
- Suggested actions like optimizing stock in high-demand states

## Insights & Findings

- Some states consistently outperform others regardless of group
- Certain product groups peak during specific times
- Correlation between time of day and total units sold is significant

##  Sample Questions Answered

- Which product group sells the most in which state?
- When are peak sales hours?
- How do sales trends vary by region?
